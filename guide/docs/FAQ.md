Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Do I have to have the Nexus bundles or plugins already in my local Maven repository?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. The bundle/plugin will be downloaded and installed automatically to your Maven local repository, in similar fashion as a usual Maven build will do.

Why My IT does not pick up the plugin built by reactor?
-------------------------------------------------------

Plugins resolution will not include the plugins built by Maven and not installed in local repository. You will have to use `mvn install`. `mvn package` will not work.

If I set a system proprty during a test I cannot see it in another test. Why?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid interference between tests, system properties are restored by the end of test to the state they were before the test was starting.
